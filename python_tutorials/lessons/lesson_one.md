#Lesson One

##Introduction

The Python language is great!  It let's you express complex ideas an simple fashion.  We'll use Python as a tool to make other tools.  We'll use it to do mathematics.  And we'll use it to write stories.  Stories are actually a big part of programming.  You don't create the story with the code.  That's just telling the computer how to do something.  But you can use code to make the computer tell a story.  The story can be complex, like in a video game, or it can be simple, like in a website that provides a specific set of services.  In any story, knowing how to tell it in a way that the listener (which will often call the user) can understand it, is key.  That's a major part of the idea of story telling through programming.

##Our first program

If you are running linux or Mac OSX you already have the Python language available via the standard Python interpreter.  To access this you'll need to go to the command line or terminal.  The terminal was how computers used to work - you wouldn't have a visual screen or the ability to click on buttons.  Because of this, earlier "written" rather than "visual" operating system, programmers will often use this command line interface to the operating system.  The main reason is historical.  This is how things were done back then so it's just easier to still work with now.  Many older programmers will feel comfortable with this and a lot of the original knowledge from programming comes from these older programmers with their older OSes.  Another reason, and a far more practical one at that, is a text based interface works well with programming, since programming is text based.  

To open the terminal:

On Ubuntu you can type: `CTRL+ SHIFT + t`,

On Mac OSX search for a program called `terminal`,

On Windows 7 and later, you'll search for a program called `powershell`

On Windows XP and before you'll search for a program called `cmd`

I can't say for sure if Python will run on Windows XP and older, but you're certainly welcome to try!

Once you have the terminal open you'll type the following:

```
$ python
Python 2.7.10 (default, Sep 23 2015, 04:34:14) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.0 (clang-700.0.72)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

As you can see this launches the python interpreter.  If you'd see something similar to this then you'll need to install the python language.  

The next thing you'll need is a text editor for writing code (sadly normal word processing won't work well for this).
