##Mandatory Reporting

* Required to report if abuse is heard 
	* Teachers
	* Consoulers
	* 

Challenge:

* Who is a mandatory reporter?  Varies by state.
* Is all the right information available? - Build a crud app
	* Who do you report to? - 
	* What do you report on? - (Make a data standard)
	* Make UX better (currently sucks) 

* Share best practices for mandatory reporters?


RAIN - Rape Abuse

We are from the frame of mind of a crisis center.  Could also be a teacher, ems, gov't entity.

Who needs to report?  By state.
